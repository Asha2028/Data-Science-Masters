    "Ans:\n",
    "    Python is an Object-Oriented Programming language. Everything in Python is an object. Like other Object-Oriented languages, when creating objects using classes, there are four(4) basic principles for writing clean and concise code. These principles are called the four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP). These four pillars are **Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Inheritance:\n",
    "        In Python it is possible to create an object that inherits the methods and properties of another object. This is called inheritance. In inheritance, there is a parent class and a child class. A child class inherits the properties and methods of the parent class. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Polymorphism:\n",
    "        Polymorphism simply means 'many forms'. In Python this means that you can have one function or object that can be used in different ways.\n",
    "        In OOP, polymorphism can be implemented with inheritance. The methods of the child class will have the same name as those of the parent class. The child class method overrides the method inherited from the parent class, when called with the child class object. This kind of implementation is called method overriding.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Encapsulation\n",
    "         It is the process of making the data private by wrapping the data and its methods in a 'capsule' or unit, so that it cannot be accessed or modified outside the unit. This is achieved by making the variables inside a class private. \n",
    "         In python we can make variables private by prefixing the variable name with a double underscore'__'. \n",
    "         To make the variable protected, we need to prefix the variable with single underscore'_'. However, protected data can be accessed and modified outside the class.Adding a single underscore is simply a conventional way of informing other programmers that may use your code that the variable with an underscore prefix is protected and should not be modified.\n",
    "         \n",
    "     Abstraction\n",
    "         The fourth pillar of OOP is Abstraction. Abstraction is about keeping the process simple by hiding unnecessary details from the user. OR\n",
    "         Abstraction is about keeping the internal mechanics of the code hidden from the user. This reduces the complexity of the code, and ensures that we only concentrate on what is important.\n",
    "         It is achieved by creating an interface class(base class) and implementation classes(subclasses). We can create an interface class/abstract class using the in-built ABC class from the abc module. The @abstractmethod is a decorator of the abstract methods. The abstract class and its decorated methods are for declaration only, not for implementation. We cannot instantiate an object of the abstract class, we will get an error.\n",
    "         The implementation classes will have the same method name as that of the abstract class. The methods in the implementation classes will override the method in the abstract class.\n",
    "         \n",
    "         Basically, the abstraction class ensures that the focus is on WHAT should be implemented and not HOW it is implemented. The implementation is left to the subclasses."

    "Ans:\n",
    "    In object-oriented programming, whenever we define methods for a class, we use self as the first parameter in each case.\n",
    "    The self keyword is used to represent an instance (object) of the given class.\n",
    "    It allows access to the attributes and methods of each object in python. This allows each object to have its own attributes and methods. \n",
    "    Thus, even long before creating these objects, we reference the objects as self while defining the class.\n",
    "    \"self\" is just a convention not keyword in python.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Self is always pointing to current object."

    "    1. It represents the real-world relationships well.\n",
    "    2. It provides the reusability of a code.\n",
    "    3. It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclassed of B would automatical;ly inherits from class A.\n",

    "4. Hierarchial Inheritance: When more than one derived class are created from a single base this type of inheritance is called hierarchical inheritance. In this program, we have a parent (base) class and two child (derived) classes.\n",
