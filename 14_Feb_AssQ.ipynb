    "     Multithreading is a way of achieving multitasking. In multithreading, the concept of threads is used.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     In computing, a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. Any process has 3 basic components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An executable program.\n",
    "2. The associated data needed by the program (variables, work space, buffers, etc.)\n",
    "3. The execution context of the program (State of process)\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution. Also, it is the smallest unit of processing that can be performed in an OS (Operating System). In simple words, a thread is a sequence of such instructions within a program that can be executed independently of other code. For simplicity, you can assume that a thread is simply a subset of a process!\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-threading: Multiple threads can exist within one process where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each thread contains its own register set and local variables (stored in stack).\n",
    "2. All threads of a process share global variables (stored in heap) and the program code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is defined as the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the threading module provides a very simple and intuitive API for spawning multiple threads in a program. "

    "Race condition occurs when multiple threads read and write the same variable i.e. they have access to some shared data and they try to change it at the same time. In such a scenario threads are “racing” each other to access/change the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    threading module provides a Lock class to deal with the race conditions. Lock is implemented using a Semaphore object provided by the Operating System.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Deadlocks: A deadlock is a concurrency failure mode where a thread or threads wait for a condition that never occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is that the deadlock threads are unable to progress and the program is stuck or frozen and must be terminated forcefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples of the cause of threading deadlocks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread that waits on itself (e.g. attempts to acquire the same mutex lock twice).\n",
    "Threads that wait on each other (e.g. A waits on B, B waits on A).\n",
    "Thread that fails to release a resource (e.g. mutex lock, semaphore, barrier, condition, event, etc.).\n",
    "Threads that acquire mutex locks in different orders (e.g. fail to perform lock ordering).\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks may be easy to describe, but hard to detect in an application just from reading code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to develop an intuition for the causes of different deadlocks. This will help you identify deadlocks in your own code and trace down the causes of those deadlocks that you may encounter.\n"
