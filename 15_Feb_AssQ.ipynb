    "    Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time. Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken into a smaller routines that run independently. The operating system allocates these threads to the processors improving performance of the system.\n",

    "    A multiprocessing system can have:\n",
    "        1. multiprocessor, that is a computer with more than one central processor\n",
