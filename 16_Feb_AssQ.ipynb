    "Database: A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system(DBMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL(Structured Query Language): \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type: SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases(RDBMS)\n",
    "2. Language: SQL requires you to use predefined schemas to determine the structure of your data before you work with it. Also all of your data must follow the same structure. This can require significant up-front preparation which means that a change in the structure would be both difficult and disruptive to your whole system. \n",
    "3. Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable. This means that you can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like RAM, CPU or SSD. \n",
    "4. Structure: SQL databases are table-based.\n",
    "5. Property followed: SQL databases follow ACID properties(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability)\n",
    "6. Support: Great support is available for all SQL database from their vendors. Also a lot of independent consultations are there who can help you with SQL database for a very large scale deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL(Not only Structured Query Language): \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type: NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.\n",
    "2. Language: A NoSQL database has dynamic schema for unstructured data.Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based or organized as a KeyValue store. This flexibility means that documents can be created without having defined structure first. \n",
    "3. Scalability: NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. This means that you handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more servers in your NoSQL database. Thus NoSQL can ultimately become larger and more powerful, making these databases the preferred choice for large or ever-changing data sets.\n",
    "4. Structure: NoSQL databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases or wide-column stores.\n",
    "5. Property followed: NoSQL follows the Brewers CAP theorem(Consistency, Availabilty and Partition tolerance)\n",
    "6. Support: NoSQL database you still have to rely on community support and only limited outside experts are available for setting up and deploying your large scale NoSQL deployments. \n",

    "DDL(Data Definition Language):\n",
    "    It is considered to be a subset of SQL. A data definition language (DDL) is a computer language used to create and modify the structure of database objects in a database. These database objects include views, schemas, tables, indexes, etc.\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employee (Employee Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, First name CHAR (50) NULL, Last name CHAR (75) NOT NULL);\n",
    "\n",
    "The mandatory semi-colon at the end of the statement is used to process every command before it. In this example, the string CHAR is used to specify the data type. Other data types can be DATE, NUMBER, or INTEGER.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alter:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alter\n",
    "An alter command modifies an existing database table. This command can add up additional column, drop existing columns and even change the data type of columns involved in a database table.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alter command syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER object type object name parameters;\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Employee ADD PRIMARY KEY (employee_pk);\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we added a unique primary key to the table to add a constraint and enforce a unique value. The constraint “employee_pk” is a primary key and is on the Employee table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drop:\n",
    "\n",
    "A drop command is used to delete objects such as a table, index or view. A DROP statement cannot be rolled back, so once an object is destroyed, there’s no way to recover it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drop statement syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP object type object name;\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE Employee;\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we’re deleting the Employee table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to DROP, the TRUNCATE statement is used to quickly remove all records from a table. However, unlike DROP that completely destroys a table, TRUNCATE preserves its full structure to be reused later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncate statement syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE Employee;\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we’re marking all the extents of the Employee table for deallocation, so they’re considered empty for reuse."
